# Objective:
### Every year during October, Breast Cancer Awareness campaigns are put together to increase the awareness of the disease. Many forget to take the necessary steps to have a plan to detect the disease in its early stages. We plan to use the information gathered in this study to automatically detect if a breast tumor is malignant or benign. We will use machine learning to help with early diagnosis of breast cancer by analyzing the characteristics found in the digitized images of hundreds of tumors to determine whether they are malignant or benign.

# Outline
### We utilized Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to prepare and clean our data. 
### Postgres was used to load our database. 
### For our visualizations, we utilized Tableau.
### Once our data was cleaned, we built the ML model. We trained and tested the dataset with multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best ML model. 




# Our Research Questions:
        *1. Could we detect if a breast tumor is malignant or benign?
        *2. Which characteristics are most relevant? 
        *3. Which were the best parameters used during optimization?


# AS The Pink Avengers...We hope our efforts of using ML models to detect Breast Cancer, helps save the lives of breast cancer patients!
